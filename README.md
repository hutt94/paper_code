This repository contains the code for my conference and journal publications on sites.google.com/site/ustcnewly/research. Most of the code are written in MATLAB, and some in C. The correspondences between code folder and paper are as follows,

1. **sMIL\_PI\_DA**: Li Niu \*, Wen Li \*, and Dong Xu, "Exploiting Privileged Information from Web Data for Image Categorization", ECCV, 2014. \* indicates equal contribution.

2. **WSDG**: Li Niu, Wen Li, and Dong Xu, "Visual Recognition by Learning from Web Data: A Weakly Supervised Domain Generalization Approach", CVPR, 2015.

3. **MVDG**:  Li Niu, Wen Li, and Dong Xu, "Multi-view Domain Generalization for Visual Recognition", ICCV, 2015. 

4. **MIL\_PI\_DA**: Li Niu, Wen Li, and Dong Xu, "Exploiting Privileged Information from Web Data for Action and Event Recognition", IJCV, 2015.

5. **MDAHS+**: Li Niu, Xinxing Xu, Lin Chen, Lixin Duan, and Dong Xu, "Action and Event Recognition in Videos by Learning from Heterogeneous Web Sources", T-NNLS, 2016. 

6. **EMVDG**: Li Niu, Wen Li, Dong Xu, and Jianfei Cai, "An Exemplar-based Multi-view Domain Generalization Framework for Visual Recognition", T-NNLS, 2016.

This repository also contains two subfolders: utils and tools, which include the utility functions and commonly used libraries respectively. Please copy these two folders under each code folder (e.g., WSDG) corresponding to each paper in order to run the code successfully.
